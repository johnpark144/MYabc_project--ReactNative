  This is English study app named 'MYabc' that I built to study with vocablary to memrize, dictionary, video and grammar.
- Reason of creation :
  When I came to states for the first time, I found it hard to do everything due to language barrier.
  I remember how my English get improved going through many trials and errors, that is studying context of frequent word and sentences,
  and also checking meaning of words in English was helpfull a lot to feel the true meaning,
  that's why I used to use Eng/Eng Dictionary and Youglish site in bookmark in actuality.
  retrospecting that time, I came to think that would be good to develop the website or application for English study based on my experience.
  and put them into practice. and I already created 'MYabc' website, so I also created this app like the website
